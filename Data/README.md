Z32_direct.dat ->  \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation
Z22_MST.dat -> \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation
Z32_MST.dat ->  \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation

Data for GW flux (after summing over positive and negative mGW)
fluxGWl2m2.dat -> dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2 for the \tide{l}=\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method
fluxGWl3m2.dat  -> dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2 for the \tide{l}=3,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method
(first column is M\mu, second column is dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2)

All quantities have been computed assuming $\chi=\chi_f$, eq. 12 in [arXiv:1810.03812](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03812.pdf). In
