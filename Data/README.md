# Data

Data has computed assuming that the dimensionless black hole spin is given by chi=chi_f, eq. 12 in [arXiv:1810.03812](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03812.pdf).

### Data for amplitudes A as defined in eq.(19) of  [arXiv:1810.03812](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03812.pdf): 

- first column: M\mu, second column: amplitude A

Z22_direct.dat -> \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation

Z32_direct.dat ->  \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation

Z22_MST.dat -> \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation

Z32_MST.dat ->  \tide{l}=2,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method to compute homogeneous solutions to Teukoslky's equation


### Data for GW flux. Note that a summation over positive and negative mGW is done using the negative mGW modes contribute equally to the GW flux.

- first column: M\mu, second column: dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2
:
fluxGWl2m2.dat -> dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2 for the \tide{l}=\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method

fluxGWl3m2.dat  -> dE/dt/(M_s/M)^2 for the \tide{l}=3,\tide{m}=2 GW mode, using direct integration method
